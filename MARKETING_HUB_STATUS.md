# 🎨 Marketing Hub - Current Status

## 📊 **What's Working:**

### ✅ **Image Generation:**
- **Status:** FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- **Evidence:** 4 images successfully uploaded to Supabase Storage
- **Sizes:** 1.6MB (DALL-E 3 fallback) and 27KB (canvas placeholder)
- **Models:** Intelligent fallback system working
  1. Tries DALL-E 3 (if `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` exists)
  2. Falls back to Stability AI (if `VITE_STABILITY_API_KEY` exists)
  3. Creates branded canvas placeholder (always works)

### ✅ **Image Upload:**
- **Storage Bucket:** `marketing-images` (public)
- **Path Structure:** `{user_id}/marketing/{timestamp}-{filename}.png`
- **Public URLs:** Correctly generated via `getPublicUrl()`

### ✅ **Text Generation:**
- Gemini 2.5 Flash generating captions
- Hashtags generation working
- Brand context injection functional

## ❓ **Unknown Status: Post Saving**

### **Current Investigation:**
- **Database Table:** `marketing_posts` is **EMPTY** (0 rows)
- **Images Generated:** 4 images in storage
- **Conclusion:** Posts are not being saved after generation

### **Possible Causes:**
1. **Silent failure** in `handleSaveDraft()` function
2. **RLS policy** blocking INSERT operations
3. **Authentication issue** (user session expired)
4. **JSON serialization error** with `media_urls` array

---

## 🔧 **Debugging Added:**

### **Comprehensive Console Logging:**
All key functions now log to browser console:
- `[Save Draft]` - Post save attempts
- `[useCreatePost]` - Database mutations
- `[Image Gen]` - Image generation steps
- `[DraftsSection]` - Image loading errors

### **How to Use:**
1. Open browser console (`F12`)
2. Try creating and saving a post
3. Look for these log prefixes
4. Share any errors you see

## 🧪 **Test Instructions:**

### **Test 1: Generate & Save Post**
```
1. Marketing Hub → "Create Post"
2. Platform: LinkedIn
3. Content Type: Image
4. Headline: "Test Post Debug"
5. Key Points: "Testing image generation"
6. Click "Generate"
7. Wait for completion
8. Click "Save Draft"
9. Check console for logs
```

**Expected Logs:**
```
[Image Gen] Model: gemini, Enhanced prompt: ...
[Image Gen] Upload successful: https://...
[Save Draft] Starting save: { platform: "linkedin", ... }
[useCreatePost] Starting mutation: { ... }
[useCreatePost] User ID: ...
[useCreatePost] Inserting data: { ... }
[useCreatePost] Post created successfully: { id: ... }
✓ Toast: "Draft saved successfully!"
```

## 📋 **MCP Checks Performed:**

### ✅ **Verified:**
- `marketing_posts` table exists with correct schema
- `storage.objects` contains 4 generated images
- `storage.buckets` configured as public
- `media_urls` column type is `jsonb`

### ❓ **Need to Check:**
1. **RLS Policies on `marketing_posts`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'marketing_posts';
   ```

2. **User Authentication Status:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email FROM auth.users LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Any failed insert attempts in logs:**
   ```sql
   -- Check if there are any application logs
   ```

---

## 🎯 **Next Actions:**

### **For You (User):**
1. Open the app with browser console visible
2. Try creating a post with image
3. Click "Save Draft"
4. **Copy ALL console logs** and share them
5. Check if you see any error toasts

### **For Me (Once you share logs):**
1. Analyze the exact error
2. Check RLS policies if auth error
3. Fix data serialization if JSON error
4. Add migration if schema issue

---

## 💡 **Likely Issue:**

Based on the evidence:
- Images are being generated ✅
- Images are being uploaded ✅
- `marketing_posts` table is empty ❌

**Most Probable Cause:** RLS policy blocking INSERT

**Quick Fix to Test:**
```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS to test
ALTER TABLE marketing_posts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Try saving a post

-- If it works, re-enable and add correct policy
ALTER TABLE marketing_posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own posts"
ON marketing_posts
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## 📞 **What I Need From You:**

**Please run this test and share:**
1. Browser console logs (full output)
2. Any error toasts that appear
3. Your Supabase project URL (if not already shared)

With these, I can pinpoint the exact issue and fix it immediately! 🚀
