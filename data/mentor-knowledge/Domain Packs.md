# **⭐ DOMAIN 1 — MARKETING (0 → 1 Startups)**

### **“Marketing is not about shouting louder. It’s about saying the one thing your ICP can’t ignore.”**

---

# **✅ 50 CORE MARKETING PRINCIPLES (High-Signal, Zero-Fluff)**

### **Foundations**

1. Marketing is understanding the customer better than they understand themselves.

2. Great products fail with bad messaging; average products win with clear messaging.

3. Clarity \> creativity.

4. Emotions drive decisions; logic justifies them.

5. People buy outcomes, not features.

6. If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it.

7. You are not your customer.

8. The market decides the value — not you.

9. Awareness without trust is useless.

10. Trust without consistency is fragile.

### **Customer & ICP**

11. Choose your ICP by *pain intensity* and *willingness to pay*.

12. Solve a problem for “someone,” not “everyone.”

13. All great marketing begins with deep customer interviews.

14. The best messaging comes from customer language, not founder imagination.

15. ICP evolves — refine it every 3–6 months.

### **Messaging**

16. Messaging must match the prospect’s mental model, not your product structure.

17. Position your product against a villain (the painful “old way”).

18. Sell the transformation, not the tool.

19. Speak to a single problem at a time.

20. Your hook decides if the user reads anything else.

### **Offer & Value**

21. The strongest offer removes all risk from the buyer.

22. People pay for clarity, convenience, confidence.

23. A simple offer beats a complicated one every time.

24. Value stacking works only if each layer solves a real pain.

25. The perceived value must exceed the actual price by at least 10x.

### **Channels & Distribution**

26. One channel at a time → master → expand.

27. Choose channels based on customer behavior, not what everyone else is doing.

28. Paid ads amplify demand; they do not create demand.

29. Organic content compounds over time — ads decay instantly.

30. The only sustainable channel is one your competition can’t easily copy.

### **Content**

31. Teach → Build trust → Convert.

32. Specificity beats generality.

33. Good content solves a problem; great content shifts identity.

34. Stories outperform statistics.

35. Demonstration is stronger than description.

### **Brand**

36. A brand is a promise delivered consistently.

37. Consistency creates familiarity; familiarity creates trust.

38. A great brand is felt, not explained.

39. Branding is the accumulated memory of experiences.

40. Brand ≠ logo; brand \= reputation.

### **Growth & Analytics**

41. You can’t improve what you don’t measure.

42. Focus on leading indicators (retention, engagement, activation).

43. Growth is not an event; it’s a system.

44. Optimize for depth, not breadth.

45. Experimentation is mandatory — guessing is not.

### **Psychology**

46. Loss aversion is stronger than desire.

47. Social proof reduces risk perception.

48. People make decisions emotionally and defend them rationally.

49. The best marketing feels like education, not persuasion.

50. Urgency without trust feels manipulative; urgency with trust accelerates action.

# **⭐ DOMAIN 0 — GTM (GO-TO-MARKET)**

*(Treat this as the backbone of your entire Mentor system.)*

---

# **✅ I. 50 CORE GTM PRINCIPLES**

(You already got these earlier, but I’m refining them \+ adding 10 more to make the full 50.)

### **Foundational**

1. GTM is not marketing or sales — it is *how your product reaches your customer*.

2. A weak GTM can kill a strong product.

3. Before PMF, distribution matters more than features.

4. You cannot outsource GTM until after PMF.

5. Founder-led sales are mandatory in the early stage.

6. Clarity \> cleverness in every GTM decision.

7. If the problem isn’t urgent, GTM will always fail.

8. Retention is the strongest GTM signal.

9. GTM follows the product, not the other way around.

10. What feels small (first 10–30 users) matters more than everything later.

### **ICP**

11. GTM is 80% “who” and 20% “how.”

12. You need only one ICP to succeed at first.

13. Choose customers who feel a “burning pain,” not mild inconvenience.

14. ICP clarity dictates messaging clarity.

15. ICP evolves; GTM must evolve with it.

### **Problem & Pain**

16. Solve a real pain, not a perceived pain.

17. Pain must be intense, frequent, and monetizable.

18. Customers who feel the pain will help you shape GTM.

19. GTM fails when founders try to “educate” the market.

20. Customers only take action when the pain becomes unbearable.

### **Positioning**

21. Position against a villain: the old, painful way.

22. Nail positioning before thinking about channels.

23. Good positioning makes your product inevitable.

24. People must instantly “get” what you do.

25. If you can’t pitch your product in one sentence, you’re not ready to GTM.

### **Messaging**

26. Your messaging must mirror customer language.

27. People buy progress, not product.

28. Every GTM message should trigger an emotional response.

29. Plan messaging around the “moment of maximum pain.”

30. Your hook determines your success.

### **Channels**

31. Go deep, not wide (one channel → mastery → scale).

32. Find channels based on where the ICP already hangs out.

33. Early channels must be high-touch, not automated.

34. Channel quality is more important than channel size.

35. Channels vary by startup stage — evolve as you grow.

### **Sales**

36. Build trust before pitching.

37. Conversations \> funnels in the early stage.

38. Discovery \> demo.

39. Objections \= misalignment, not rejection.

40. Great sales \= great listening.

### **Experiments & Iterations**

41. Test hypotheses, not tactics.

42. Small experiments → high insight.

43. Kill experiments fast if they don’t show signal.

44. Time-box all experiments.

45. Document everything you test.

### **Pricing**

46. Customers must feel like the value \> price × 10\.

47. Price is part of GTM, not finance.

48. Premium positioning demands premium pricing.

49. If no one negotiates, you are underpriced.

50. Free users are not your ICP; don’t optimize GTM for them.

---

# **❌ II. Top 10 GTM Mistakes Founders Make**

1. Too many ICPs at once.

2. Copying competitor channels blindly.

3. Building before validating.

4. Relying on ads before clarity.

5. No founder-led customer conversations.

6. Weak positioning and unclear messaging.

7. Interpreting compliments as validation.

8. Not measuring retention.

9. Premature scaling.

10. Thinking GTM \= marketing only.

---

# **🧠 III. 10 GTM Mental Models**

1. **The Pain–Frequency Matrix**  
    High pain \+ high frequency → strong GTM.

2. **The JTBD (Jobs-to-be-Done)**  
    What job are customers hiring your product to do?

3. **The Ladder of Awareness (Eugene Schwartz)**  
    Message must match customer awareness stage.

4. **The Trough of Disinterest**  
    Most GTM fails because the message doesn’t grab attention.

5. **Value Pathway**  
    Trigger → Consideration → Trial → Habit → Advocacy.

6. **The Chasm (Geoffrey Moore)**  
    Early adopters ≠ early majority.

7. **Demand Curve Matching**  
    Your offer must meet the psychological demand curve.

8. **PMF as a Gradient (not a switch)**  
    Small wins → bigger wins → market pull.

9. **High-Velocity Testing (Reforge)**  
    Rapid experimentation beats perfect planning.

10. **Behavioral GTM**  
     People buy based on emotion → justify logically.

# **⭐ DOMAIN 2 — SALES (0 → 1 Startups)**

### **“Sales is not pushing. Sales is understanding the truth of someone’s pain and helping them solve it.”**

---

# **✅ I. 50 CORE SALES PRINCIPLES**

### **Foundational**

1. Early-stage sales must be founder-led.

2. Sales is not talking — it’s listening.

3. The goal of a sales call is *clarity*, not pressure.

4. Discovery \> Demo.

5. Questions create insight; pitches create resistance.

6. Selling starts when the prospect says their first pain point.

7. People love buying; they hate being sold to.

8. Urgency must come from pain, not tactics.

9. A confused mind never buys.

10. Build trust first, value second, offer last.

### **Discovery**

11. Great discovery calls make demos unnecessary.

12. Three layers of discovery: emotional → functional → financial pain.

13. Ask “why” until you reach the root.

14. Understand the consequences of inaction.

15. Discovery must be conversational, not interrogative.

### **Qualifying**

16. Not every prospect deserves your product.

17. Sell only to people who have urgency \+ agency \+ budget.

18. Demos should be earned, not given.

19. Disqualifying is as important as qualifying.

20. Don’t chase prospects who don’t feel pain.

### **Pitching**

21. Pitch only after understanding the pain.

22. Tailor your pitch to the ICP, not the product roadmap.

23. Show how the product solves *their* specific problem.

24. Use customer stories, not features.

25. Demonstrate outcomes, not features.

### **Objections**

26. Objections are clues to misalignment.

27. Objections \= fear, not rejection.

28. Treat objections with curiosity, not defense.

29. Never argue with a prospect — align, clarify, resolve.

30. The real objection is rarely the first one stated.

### **Closing**

31. Closing is not a moment; it’s a process.

32. Ask for the close clearly but calmly.

33. People buy when they trust you \+ believe you \+ want progress.

34. Scarcity works only when value is clear.

35. If the next step is unclear, the deal dies.

### **Momentum & Follow-Up**

36. Time kills deals.

37. Follow-up must be value-first, not pestering.

38. Every follow-up should move the deal forward.

39. Summaries after calls reduce confusion.

40. Set the next step before the call ends.

### **Pricing & Negotiation**

41. Price anchors the perception of value.

42. Negotiation is collaborative, not adversarial.

43. If you discount, reduce scope — never value.

44. If prospects don’t negotiate, the price is too low.

45. State price confidently — hesitation kills trust.

### **Founder Psychology**

46. Desperation kills deals; calm confidence closes them.

47. Don’t chase. Attract.

48. Your emotion sets the tone.

49. The prospect buys *you* before they buy the product.

50. Being honest is the strongest sales advantage.

# **⭐ DOMAIN 3 — TECH & PRODUCT (0 → 1\)**

### **“The goal is not to build more. The goal is to build what matters.”**

---

# **✅ I. 50 CORE TECH / PRODUCT PRINCIPLES**

(These blend engineering, product thinking, and early-stage constraints.)

### **Foundational**

1. Build the simplest version that solves the core problem.

2. Reduce scope → speed goes up → clarity improves.

3. Product is not features; product is the user’s progress.

4. You don’t need a CTO to start — you need clarity.

5. Most products fail because they build too much, too early.

6. Technology should serve the problem, not the founder’s ego.

7. If your product requires explanation, the design has failed.

8. Early stage \= manual, scrappy, brute-force solutions.

9. UI matters more than features in the first 100 users.

10. Great product \= less friction, not more functionality.

### **MVP**

11. An MVP must be fast, cheap, ugly…and useful.

12. Build only what you need to learn — nothing more.

13. Fake features are better than unnecessary features.

14. Your first “product” should often be a Google Sheet.

15. The purpose of MVP is validation, not scale.

### **Customer Understanding**

16. You are not the user — test everything.

17. Observe behavior, don’t trust feedback.

18. Customers lie unintentionally; data doesn’t.

19. Watch where users struggle; friction reveals truth.

20. Solve the user’s job-to-be-done, not what they request.

### **Technical Architecture**

21. A simple system is easier to scale than a complex one.

22. Over-architecting destroys momentum.

23. Choose boring technology that works reliably.

24. Build modular systems from day one.

25. Document everything simply (future team will thank you).

### **Speed**

26. Ship weekly.

27. If it takes more than 2 weeks, it’s too big.

28. Speed compounds like interest — slow teams die.

29. Done \> perfect.

30. Releasing imperfect features teaches you more than planning perfect ones.

### **AI & Automation**

31. Automate only what is predictable.

32. LLMs should assist thinking, not replace product strategy.

33. Use AI for superpowers, not shortcuts.

34. AI requires constraints → without them, it becomes noise.

35. Data quality \> model quality at early stage.

### **Tech Debt**

36. Tech debt is not bad — unmanaged tech debt is bad.

37. Delete features ruthlessly.

38. Cleanup cycles must be scheduled every month.

39. Bugs are learning signals.

40. Prioritize stability over sophistication.

### **Team & Execution**

41. Early teams should be tiny — 2 to 4 people.

42. Founder must understand enough tech to manage decisions.

43. Clear specs reduce conflict & rework.

44. Engineers build better with real constraints.

45. Product decisions need real users, not opinions.

### **Scaling**

46. Premature scale breaks companies.

47. Build a system that survives growth — not popularity.

48. Monitor usage patterns before optimizing.

49. Data-informed \> data-obsessed.

50. Scalability is a phase, not a starting point.

---

# **⭐ DOMAIN 4 — OPERATIONS (OPS)**

### **“Operations is how your startup behaves when no one is watching.”**

---

# **✅ I. 50 CORE OPERATIONS PRINCIPLES**

### **Foundational**

1. Operations is the backbone of every functioning startup.

2. Chaos is a tax — the more chaos, the more productivity dies.

3. Systems \> talent.

4. Clear processes reduce mistakes, cost, and emotional load.

5. A startup without systems will collapse once growth begins.

6. Ops \= consistency.

7. You cannot scale a startup that depends on individual heroics.

8. High-performing teams run on clarity, not pressure.

9. A good process makes the right thing easy.

10. Ops is how strategy becomes reality.

### **Workflows & Processes**

11. Process isn’t bureaucracy — it is the reduction of repeated decision-making.

12. Document everything simple now to prevent chaos later.

13. Every recurring task should have a checklist.

14. Process should follow common sense, not tradition.

15. If a process is confusing, the process is wrong.

### **Tools & Systems**

16. Tools amplify good systems; they do not replace them.

17. Start with fewer tools, expand only when absolutely needed.

18. Integrations matter more than tool count.

19. Maintain a single source of truth (SSOT).

20. Tools should reduce friction, not add learning complexity.

### **Execution**

21. A good plan executed now beats a perfect plan executed late.

22. Ops is about removing ambiguity.

23. Delegation requires clarity of expectations.

24. Execution dies without follow-through.

25. Deadlines create momentum.

### **Metrics & Tracking**

26. What gets measured improves; what doesn’t gets ignored.

27. Track leading indicators, not vanity metrics.

28. Ops must align with business goals.

29. Review processes every month.

30. Weekly dashboards \> daily chaos.

### **Team & Communication**

31. Overcommunication is better than assumptions.

32. Clear roles solve 50% of internal conflict.

33. Meetings should produce decisions, not updates.

34. Written documentation beats verbal discussions.

35. New team members onboard faster with documented systems.

### **Risk & Crisis Management**

36. Every startup must prepare for failure scenarios.

37. Ops \= antifragility.

38. Build buffers into workloads.

39. Redundancy prevents collapse.

40. Crisis reveals the quality of your operations.

### **Scaling Ops**

41. Don’t scale complexity — scale clarity.

42. Complexity increases exponentially as teams grow.

43. Build scalable systems before adding headcount.

44. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) protect speed.
