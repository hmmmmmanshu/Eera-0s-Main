    questions: [
      {
        question: "What exactly is EERA?",
        answer: "EERA is an AI Founder & Creator OS: one workspace that helps you plan, market, sell, and operate without juggling multiple tools or hires. It's your complete Founder's Office in the Cloud, powered by the world's smartest evolving AI."
      },
      {
        question: "Who is it for?",
        answer: "Early-stage founders, creators, and 1â€“10 person teams building SaaS, D2C, services, or content-led businesses. Whether you're launching a startup or scaling a creator business, EERA gives your small team superpowers."
      },
      {
        question: "How is EERA different from ChatGPT or a CRM?",
        answer: "ChatGPT is a single tool. EERA is a connected operating system with hubs for marketing, sales, finance, ops, tech, and legal, plus a cognitive hub that remembers your context and routes tasks to the best model automatically. It's an entire workspace, not just a chatbot."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Features & Intelligence",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Which AI models does EERA use?",
        answer: "We dynamically connect to top-performing models in each category (writing, analysis, vision, code) including GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok. EERA chooses what's best for the task, so you don't have to. It's always up-to-date with the latest AI advancements."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I still need subscriptions to other AI tools?",
        answer: "Not for core work. EERA aggregates best-in-class models behind one subscription, so you avoid switching costs and constant retraining. You get the power of multiple AI tools unified in one intelligent workspace."
      },
      {
        question: "Does EERA replace a team?",
        answer: "EERA can replace the early 'Founder's Office' and augment your small team, often doing the work of multiple roles (content, sales ops, FP&A, PM) so you can keep the team lean and move faster."
      },
      {
        question: "How does EERA handle my data and privacy?",
        answer: "Your data lives in your workspace with strict access controls. EERA's cognitive memory is private to your account and used only to serve your outputs. We never train on your data or share it with third parties."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Usage & Integration",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Can EERA post and send on my behalf?",
        answer: "Yes - connect channels (email, LinkedIn, etc.) and EERA can draft, schedule, and send after your approval. You stay in control while EERA handles the execution."
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a mobile app?",
        answer: "We're launching web first; mobile is next so you can work with EERA anywhere. The web version works beautifully on mobile browsers in the meantime."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
        answer: "Yes - no lock-ins. Export your work whenever you like. We believe in earning your subscription every month."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Beta & Pricing",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What does beta include and how do I join?",
        answer: "Beta includes the Dashboard, Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and early Finance snapshots. Join the waitlist above; we'll onboard in small cohorts of the first 200 users."
      },
      {
        question: "How much will it cost after beta?",
        answer: "We'll offer simple plans for solo builders and small teams. Beta users get preferred pricing for life as a thank you for being early believers."
